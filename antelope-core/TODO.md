# TODO / FIXME

## CORRECTNESS / TESTING

- IMPORTANT
  unittests for base types should have at least the following:
  - basic functionality
  - invalid values
  - (de)serialization to JSON

- have some tests for `APIClient`, think how to do this smartly to not pound the API server

- do the other tests from here: <https://github.com/FACINGS/pyntelope/blob/main/tests/unit/types_test.py>

- check other tests and ideas from: <https://github.com/wharfkit/antelope>


## MISSING FEATURES

- crypto primitives do not implement WebAuthn key and signatures yet
