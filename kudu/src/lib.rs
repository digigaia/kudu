//!
//! This library provides data types and functions to interact with
//! [Antelope](https://antelope.io) blockchains.
//!
//! The basic types can be found in the [`types`] module, and the variant type used to represent
//! values handled by Antelope blockchains is [`AntelopeValue`].
//!
//! There is a to-do list of items needing to be completed before a first release here:
//! [To-Do list](doc::todo), and a list of notes and resources here: [Notes](doc::notes)
//!
//! You can also read an overview of the [architecture and design decisions](doc::architecture).
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! - `cli`: whether to compile the command-line tools alongside the library.
//! - `detailed-error`: activate this to enable the [`macro@with_location`] macro. If
//!                     not enabled, the [`macro@with_location`] macro will be a no-op.
//! - `hardened`: implement safeguards to check for execution time and recursion depth
//!               when validating ABIs. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!)
//! - `float128`: add support for a native `float128` type. This currently needs a nightly Rust
//!               version as `f128` support is still experimental. If this is not active,
//!               the `Float128` will still be available but as a `[u8; 16]` wrapper.

//!
//! Data used in the Antelope blockchains can be found in a variety of formats, namely:
//!  - Rust native data types (structs defined in this library)
//!  - JSON Value (`serde_json::Value`) (also called variant in Antelope terminology)
//!  - JSON string representation
//!  - binary data
//!
//! The diagram above shows those types and the different ways to convert between them.
//!  - most of the conversions are handled via the `serde::Serialize` and `serde::Deserialize`
//!    traits.
//!  - to convert between a JSON value and a binary stream you need to use an instance
//!    of the [`ABI`] class which has been initialized with a data schema
//!    ([`ABIDefinition`]).
//!  - to convert between a Rust native value and a binary stream you need to use the
//!    [`ABISerializable`] trait, which you can automatically derive using the
//!    [`ABISerializable`](macro@ABISerializable) derive macro.
//!
//! ## Traits implemented for native types
//!
//! Wherever possible, the following traits are implemented for the base types:
//!  - [`Clone`], and also [`Copy`] when the struct size isn't prohibitively big
//!  - [`Debug`](std::fmt::Debug) and [`Display`](std::fmt::Display)
//!  - [`FromStr`](std::str::FromStr), allowing most types to be constructed from their `str`
//!    representation via [`str::parse()`]
//!  - [`PartialEq`], [`Eq`], [`PartialOrd`], [`Ord`], [`Hash`]
//!
//! <div class="warning">
//!
//! ## Warnings / pitfalls
//!
//!  - when defining your own types, if you have a bytes field make sure to use the [`Bytes`]
//!    type instead of `Vec<u8>` otherwise the JSON serialization will not be correct.
//!  - when defining a variant type using a Rust enum, you need to use the [`SerializeEnum`]
//!    derive macro instead of `serde::Serialize` and `serde::Deserialize`. This is because
//!    the discriminant needs to be encoded in a specific way which cannot be achieved with
//!    the `serde::Serialize` trait.
//!
//! </div>
//!
//! # Differences between this library and the Antelope C++ library
//!
//!  - hex numbers here are lowercase whereas C++ outputs hex data in upper case
//!  - C++ outputs `i64` and `u64` as double-quoted, this library doesn't



// disable this lint to allow our types to implement a `from_str` constructor
// without implement the `std::str::FromStr` trait
// if we didn't, we would have to import that trait everywhere we want to build
// our types, which wouldn't be very convenient and isn't very discoverable
